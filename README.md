# Website Design  

The theme of our website is "UFO recordings". Through this website, users can record the appearance of UFOs, such as when and where, shapes and duration of UFOs and so on after they sign up/in. Users can also search the records of UFOs from the website. Based on this theme, we drafted the layout of our homepage and created several different modules on the left bar. To implement the search function, we added MySQL connections via PHP to query among massive tables MariaDB. Then we generated HTML outputs dynamically with PHP and CSS and paged out the results in tabular form.
