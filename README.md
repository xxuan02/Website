# Website Design  

The theme of our website is "UFO recordings". Through this website, users can:

- Record the appearance of UFOs, such as when and where, shapes and duration of UFOs and so on after they sign up/in;  
- Users can also search the records of UFOs from the website,  
- PHP provides the mysql_connect() function to open a database connection. It also provides the mysql_close() function to close the database connection.

Based on this theme, we drafted the layout of our homepage and created several different modules on the left bar. To implement the search function, we added MariaDB connections via PHP to query among massive tables. Then we generated reactive HTML pages, and showcased the summary in tabular forms with CSS pagination to make it scrollable.
